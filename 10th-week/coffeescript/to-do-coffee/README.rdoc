== To-Do Coffee

This simple Rails app is meant to serve as a practice for CoffeeScript. Students should create *home.js.coffee* in the same directory as *home.js*, and likewise convert all JS to CoffeeScript. Once the CoffeeScript is in place and functional, the original JS should be removed. At completion, the app should run as designed.
