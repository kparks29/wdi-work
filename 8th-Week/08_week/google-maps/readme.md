#Google Maps Two Ways

Today, we're going to explore using Google Maps in two ways: with a gem (gmaps4rails) and with plain JavaScript.

###[gem_breakfast_spots](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_3-4/tree/master/08_week/google-maps/gem_breakfast_spots)

This is the base for the gmaps4rails version of our breakfast spot mapper. It starts out the same as the JavaScript version, but the $maincolor variable in the stylesheet is set to red for easy identification. 

In class, we'll add a Google Map to this app's index view using the gem. After both cohorts have had this lesson, this Readme will be updated and the gem-based solution file will be located here.

###[js_breakfast_spots](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_3-4/tree/master/08_week/google-maps/js_breakfast_spots)

This is the base for the JavaScript version of our breakfast spot mapper. It starts out the same as the gem version, but the $maincolor variable in the stylesheet is set to purple for easy identification.

In class, we'll add a Google Map to this app's index view using plain JavaScript. After both cohorts have had this lesson, this Readme will be updated and the JS-based solution file will be located here.

After both cohorts have had this lesson, the plain base file will be posted here.
