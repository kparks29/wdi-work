#Google Maps for Rails -- JavaScript

This is meant to be a basic sample of what the Google Maps JavaScript API can do (gem-free); please feel free to continue researching and experimenting on your own. The Maps API creators intended for all user functions to be available to developers as well.

###As a class, we will:

- Take a look at the [Google Maps documentation/tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) and sign up for API keys
- Pull down this app (and bundle install, rake db:create, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, etc.)
- Incorporate a simple map with a marker

###In teams or individually, you will:

- Use Google, StackOverflow, or your own problem-solving skills to map an array of markers. We've seeded the DB with a set of locations to get you started.


###If you want an extra challenge:

- Try to make use of your favorite Maps features:
	- Map out a specific region with a polygon or polyline
	- Provide your users with directions from one place to another (or from their current location to a selected destination)
	- Create a custom map style
	- Do something else super cool that we haven't specified (Google Maps has a very robust and well-documented API!)
